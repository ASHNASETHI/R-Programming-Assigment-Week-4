# This is the Codebook for the week 4 assignment - Getting and Cleaning data in Coursera 
## The data was sourced from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
## The data for the project was taken from here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- the file had to be downloaded and unzipped before USE

The run.analysis.R code follows five steps outlined in the assignment framework. 
Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Reading files including
  -trainings tables
  -Reading testing tables
  -Reading feature vector
  -Reading activity labels
-Assigning variable names
-Merging all data in one set
-Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Reading variable names
-Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
-Making nessesary subset from merged data set
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
-Making second tidy data set
-Writing second tidy data set in txt file

Info about Variables in this Data Set 
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test are the variables that contain the data from the downloaded files
x_data, y_data and merged_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
